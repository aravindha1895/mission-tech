 * Given a constant array of n elements which contains elements from 1 to n-1,
 * with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find any one of these repeating numbers
 * in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
 * Examples:
 * Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3}
 * Output : 3
 * Here is an approach that is based on Floydâ€™s cycle finding algorithm. We use this to detect loop in a linked list.
 * The idea is to consider array items as linked list nodes. Any particular index is pointing to the value at that index.
 * And you will see that there is loop as shown in the image below- In case of duplicate, two indexes will have same
 * value and they will form a cycle just like in the image given below.
 * Linked list formed for above example would be :
 * 1->2->3->3->5->6
 * So we can find the entry point of cycle in the linked list and that will be our duplicate element.
 * We maintain two pointers fast and slow
 * For each step fast will move to the index that is equal to arr[arr[fast]](two jumps at a time)
 * and slow will move to the index arr[slow](one step at a time)
 * When fast==slow that means now we are in a cycle.
 * Fast and slow will meet in a circle and the entry point of that circle will be the duplicate element.
 * Now we need to find entry point so we will start with fast=0 and visit one step at a time for both fast and slow.
 * When fast==slow that will be entry point.
 * Return the entry point.
 * Time Complexity : O(N)
 * Auxiliary Space : O(1)

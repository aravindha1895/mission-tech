//TODO: Dynamic programming solution that solves this in O(n*x) time complexity

/**
 * There are n egg shops in Worli. Each shop can buy or sell exactly k eggs at a time.
 * The value of k will be different for different shops. You are the egg retailer with some m eggs initially.
 * You will be visiting the shops one by one in the given order. At each shop, you should buy or sell the eggs
 * such that you canâ€™t have more than x eggs at any time. At each shop, you should perform only one
 * transaction either buying or selling. You will be given the value of k of each shop.
 * Find the maximum possible eggs that can be left with you after visiting all the shops.
 * Example:
 * k values of shops = {3, 10, 6, 4, 5}*
 * m = 1
 * x = 15
 * Output: 9
 * Maximum eggs that will be left = 1+3+10-6-4+5 = 9
 * Time complexity: O(2^N)
 * Space complexity: O(N) - Recursion

/**
 * You will be given two strings. You need to find the minimum number of operations to be performed
 * on the first string to transform it into the second string. The only operation allowed is to
 * remove any character in the first string at ith position where i > 0 and inserting it at 0th position.
 * Example:
 * str1 = eabcd
 * str2 = abcde
 * Output: 4
 * eabcd -> deabc -> cdeab -> bcdea -> abcde
 * Before directly diving in to count the minimum number of operations to be performed,
 * check whether the first string can be transformed into the second string or not.
 * To verify this you need to check whether the two strings are anagrams to each other or not.
 * If the two strings are anagrams, count the number of minimum operations to be performed to transform
 * the first string into the second string. The idea is to start matching the characters from the end of
 * both strings. If the last characters match, then our task reduces to n-1 characters.
 * If last characters donâ€™t match, then find the position of the matching character of the last character
 * of the second string in the first string. The difference between these two positions indicates that
 * these many characters of the first string must be moved to the front of the first string.
 * Time complexity: O(N)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
